# MA-541 Statistical Methods Final Project
### This project involves the statistical analysis of vehicles dataset in Canada for the year 2022. The  dataset contains over 900 rows of information on fuel consumption, engine size, CO2 emissions, etc., of various vehicles. Numerous statistical tests, including F-test, Z-test, ANOVA, and chi-squared test, were conducted to explore the relationships between the variables. 
### Multiple linear regression, bootstrapping, ridge regression, lasso regression, polynomial regression, and spline regression were applied to model the data and predict CO2 emissions. These findings can provide insights for policymakers and stakeholders in the automobile industry on ways to reduce CO2 emissions and improve fuel efficiency
